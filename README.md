This is a repo of the real time use cases I have solved as part of my Data Science Journey

1. ResumeRecom.py : A Resume recommendation Engine
 Â  Every time a candidate signs up with a job portal, there is a manual effort needed to fill in the skills, experience and other details. These details are stored in a database and based on this, the profile gets shortlisted when a recruiter looks for candidates.
   To skip this manual effort, this python code mines through the resume data and pulls the relevant profiles based on the job description provided as a text file. The final matching profiles are listed in a .csv file with matching scores as %.
